\subsection{Detailed Description}
This class implements a factor base for algorighm of Quadratic Sieve. Factor base is a vector containing those primes number which have legendre number with N = 1, where N is the semiprime number we're going to factorize 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file\-:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
